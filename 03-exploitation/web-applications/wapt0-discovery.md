# WAPT1 - Discovery

You should be aiming to spend around 70% of your time here in discovery and mapping the application. The other 30% of actual testing.

When testing, aim to to use the 80/20 rule and quickly test the critical 20% first.

## WAPT1.1 - Identify IP Addressing and Top Level Domains

### ASN's

* [Hurricane Electric](https://bgp.he.net)
* [ARIN](https://www.arin.net)
* [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net)

### Reverse WHOIS

* [Reverse Report](https://reverse.report)

### Shodan

## WAPT1.2 - Subdomain Scraping

### \(T\) amass

### \(T\) subfinder

## WAPT1.3 - Subdomain Brute Forcing

The goal here is to idenitfy potential new targets. Subdomain brute forcing will take in a large list of common subdomain names or dictionary terms and cycle through them attempting to access each one.

### \(T\) massdns

`massdns` is another great tool.

```bash
# Find x
massdns
```

### \(T\) gobuster

###  Resources

The following contain some of the most comprehensive used lists including payloads and dictionaries you can use to load you your tooling.

* SecLists
* RAFT

## WAPT1.4 - Brand Discovery

### Acquisitions

Finding your targets past company acquisitions can lead to the discovery of additional targets which may also be within scope. These new targets may have the same sort of attention as the most common target TLD's \(Top Level Domains\) and so you should have a higher chance of identifying vulnerabilities.

### Analytics Tracking

## WAPT1.5 - Port Scanning

### \(T\) masscan

`masscan` is fast and capable of scanning target IP ranges. You want to be looking for things such as:

* Additional web servers on non-standard ports \(TCP/8080, TCP/8081 etc.\)
* Mail relays \(TCP/25\)
* Remote access services
  * SSH \(TCP/22\)
  * Telnet \(TCP/23\)
  * RDP \(TCP/3389\)
