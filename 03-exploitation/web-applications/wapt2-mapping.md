## WAPT2.1 - Directory Brute Forcing

We attempt to force browse the application by using a wordlist of common directory and file names. This will allow us to find potential hidden directories and files either not directly linked to or indexed.

* .git
* .svn
* Sensitive files
* Hidden directories

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to look for 401 \(Authorisation Required\) responses. Once identified, you should re-run the directory brute forcing process starting at one level above the directory which received the 401 checking for misconfigured access control, i.e. files beyond this directory may be accessible.

## WAPT2.2 - Platform Identification

This section outlines tools used to extract platform and stack related details such as coding language and infrastructure used in the target application. Once known we should check to see if any frameworks and infrastructure used has any current vulnerabilities.

* [Reddit XSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/xss)
* [PunkSpider \(Web Vulnerability Search Engine\)](https://www.punkspider.org)
* [OpenBugBounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org)
* Twitter

Issues might already be reported but use the flaw area and injection type to guide you to further injections or filter bypass.
